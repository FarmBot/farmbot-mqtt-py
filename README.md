# Where Is the Latest Documentation?

If you are reading this document anywhere other than [The official Github page](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-py), you may be reading old documentation. Please visit Github for the latest documentation.

# Requirements

We tested this package with Python 3.8 and `paho-mqtt` 1.5.

It may work with earlier versions of Python, but Python 3.8 is the supported version. Please do not report bugs with earlier python versions.

# Installation

FarmBot publishes the latest version of this package to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/farmbot/). You can install the newest version with the following command:

```
pip install farmbot
```

# Unit Testing

```
pip install -e .[dev]
pytest --cov=farmbot --cov-report html
```

# Usage

```python
from farmbot import Farmbot, FarmbotToken

# Before we begin, we must download an access token from the
# API. To avoid copy/pasting passwords, it is best to create
# an access token and then store that token securely:
raw_token = FarmbotToken.download_token("test@example.com",
                                        "password",
                                        "https://my.farm.bot")

# This token is then passed to the Farmbot constructor:
fb = Farmbot(raw_token)

# If you are just doing testing, such as local development,
# it is possible to skip token creation and login with email
# and password. This is not recommended for production devices:
# fb = Farmbot.login(email="em@i.l",
#                    password="pass",
#                    server="https://my.farm.bot")

# The next step is to call fb.connect(), but we are not ready
# to do that yet. Before we can call connect(), we must
# create a "handler" object. FarmBot control is event-based
# and the handler object is responsible for integrating all
# of those events into a custom application.
#
# At a minimum, the handler must respond to the following
# methods:
#     on_connect(self, bot: Farmbot, client: Mqtt) -> None
#     on_change(self, bot: Farmbot, state: Dict[Any, Any]) -> None
#     on_log(self, _bot: Farmbot, log: Dict[Any, Any]) -> None
#     on_error(self, _bot: Farmbot, _response: ErrorResponse) -> None
#     on_response(self, _bot: Farmbot, _response: OkResponse) -> None
#
# FarmBotPy will call the appropriate method whenever an event
# is triggered. For example, the method `on_log` will be
# called with the last log message every time a new log
# message is created.


class MyHandler:
    # The `on_connect` event is called whenever the device
    # connects to the MQTT server. You can place initialization
    # logic here.
    #
    # The callback is passed a FarmBot instance, plus an MQTT
    # client object (see Paho MQTT docs to learn more).
    def on_connect(self, bot, mqtt_client):
        # Once the bot is connected, we can send RPC commands.
        # Every RPC command returns a unique, random request
        # ID. Later on, we can use this ID to track our commands
        # as they succeed/fail (via `on_response` / `on_error`
        # callbacks):

        request_id1 = bot.move_absolute(x=10, y=20, z=30)
        # => "c580-6c-11-94-130002"
        print("MOVE_ABS REQUEST ID: " + request_id1)

        request_id2 = bot.send_message("Hello, world!")
        # => "2000-31-49-11-c6085c"
        print("SEND_MESSAGE REQUEST ID: " + request_id2)

    def on_change(self, bot, state):
        # The `on_change` event is most frequently triggered
        # event. It is called any time the device's internal
        # state changes. Example: Updating X/Y/Z position as
        # the device moves across the garden.
        # The bot maintains all this state in a single JSON
        # object that is broadcast over MQTT constantly.
        # It is a very large object, so we are printing it
        # only as an example.
        print("NEW BOT STATE TREE AVAILABLE:")
        print(state)
        # Since the state tree is very large, we offer
        # convenience helpers such as `bot.position()`,
        # which returns an (x, y, z) tuple of the device's
        # last known position:
        print("Current position: (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)" % bot.position())
        # A less convenient method would be to access the state
        # tree directly:
        pos = state["location_data"]["position"]
        xyz = (pos["x"], pos["y"], pos["z"])
        print("Same information as before: " + str(xyz))

    # The `on_log` event fires every time a new log is created.
    # The callback receives a FarmBot instance, plus a JSON
    # log object. The most useful piece of information is the
    # `message` attribute, though other attributes do exist.
    def on_log(self, bot, log):
        print("New message from FarmBot: " + log['message'])

    # When a response succeeds, the `on_response` callback
    # fires. This callback is passed a FarmBot object, as well
    # as a `response` object. The most important part of the
    # `response` is `response.id`. This `id` will match the
    # original request ID, which is useful for cross-checking
    # pending operations.
    def on_response(self, bot, response):
        print("ID of successful request: " + response.id)

    # If an RPC request fails (example: stalled motors, firmware
    # timeout, etc..), the `on_error` callback is called.
    # The callback receives a FarmBot object, plus an
    # ErrorResponse object.
    def on_error(self, bot, response):
        # Remember the unique ID that was returned when we
        # called `move_absolute()` earlier? We can cross-check
        # the ID by calling `response.id`:
        print("ID of failed request: " + response.id)
        # We can also retrieve a list of error message(s) by
        # calling response.errors:
        print("Reason(s) for failure: " + str(response.errors))


# Now that we have a handler class to use, let's create an
# instance of that handler and `connect()` it to the FarmBot:
handler = MyHandler()

# Once `connect` is called, execution of all other code will
# be pause until an event occurs, such as logs, errors,
# status updates, etc..
# If you need to run other code while `connect()` is running,
# consider using tools like system threads or processes.
# See: `example_threads.py` for inspiration.
fb.connect(handler)
print("This line will not execute. `connect()` is a blocking call.")
```
